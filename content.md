It can contain a command like `git status` that is highlighted and formatted as code. 

For longer code blockes as including a picture, we can highlight them as followed:
```
![Sample Image](sample-image.jpg)
```

To stay with that example, we can include a picture with style settings as the size:
```
img src="sample-image.jpg" alt="Sample Image" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
```
That would look like this:

<img src="sample-image.jpg" alt="Sample Image" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
